// It represents the position of a widget in the overall app structure,
// it is kind of address that tells flutter where to locate that widget

// having a screen and pushing another screen on the top of it, like in stack.
// remove until means removing the existing screen push the new one to the screen.
// like when you are logged in to the app, then you are now logged in to the app
// and you no more need the log in screen in the stack, you have moved to the
// main ui screen, then you can remove the login view from the stack becoz there
// is no mean of it to consume memory by sitting in the stack.
// "route"=> false means that remove everything from the screen until there is
// nothing left in the route.
